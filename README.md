# FridgeFind

## CPSC304 2024W1 Project - Group 28

### Project Description
FridgeFind is a kitchen management application that allows users to organize their ingredients, recipes, and other information for later use. It allows users to find recipes they can make based on what they currently have at home and/or it allows users to know what ingredients of a recipe they are missing. It also helps users in finding new recipes based on those that other users have created while also being able to filter through them based on categories and the user's allergies.
