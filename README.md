### Project Summary
This kitchen management application allows users to organize their ingredients, recipes, and other information for future use. It enables users to find recipes based on what they currently have at home or informs them of any missing ingredients for a recipe. The app also assists users in discovering new recipes created by other users, with the ability to filter recipes by categories and the user's allergies.

### Project Description
The goal of this application is to help homeowners efficiently manage their kitchen by organizing ingredients and recipes. Users can check if they have the necessary ingredients to complete a recipe or prioritize perishable items that need to be used first. The app also accommodates allergy and dietary preferences, enabling users to find or create meals for specific needs.

### Domain of the Application
Management of Food Items in a Homeowner's Kitchen

The application is designed for homeowners with kitchens, focusing on ingredient management and recipe organization. Users can:

- See if they can complete a recipe based on the ingredients they have.
- Plan meals that cater to dietary or allergy restrictions.
- Prioritize cooking perishable items.

### Database Models

##### 1. Kitchen Ingredients Management
Users can track their kitchen inventory, ensuring they have enough of each ingredient to prepare meals. The application helps users keep track of quantities and other essential information.

##### 2. Recipes
Users can create and follow recipes by adding ingredients, steps, and optional category tags (e.g., Vegetarian, Dessert). This feature allows for easy recipe recreation in the future.

##### 3. Recipe Lists
Users can store favorite recipes in personalized lists, making it easier to replicate meals later. These lists can be tailored to different dietary or allergy restrictions, and users can browse other users' lists to discover new recipes.

##### 4. Perishable Item Tracking
Users can log the expiry dates of ingredients, helping them prioritize the use of perishable items before they spoil. The app also sends notifications when an item is nearing its expiration date.


### Milestone 1
Deliverable 2
● Project Topic: Kitchen management app
● A brief project description
○ The domain of the application:
■ Management of Food Items in Homeowners Kitchen:
The domain of our application would be a homeowner that has a kitchen,
particularly the application deals with organizing a kitchen's ingredients
and a user’s recipes. The user can see based on a few factors if they can
complete a recipe. This allows them to cater meals to different crowds
based on allergy ingredients and ensure they prioritize cooking perishable
items, and if they can or cannot complete a recipe (that they or someone
else created) based on if they have all of the ingredients.
○ The aspects of the domain modeled by the database:
■ Kitchen Ingredients Management:
Our users will need to track the ingredients in their kitchen to ensure they
have enough portion size and of the certain item to make the meals they
would like to cook
Recipes:
Our users will be able to create and follow recipes by adding the
necessary ingredients, steps and optional category tags. This will allow
the user to recreate the recipe in the future by following the steps they (or
another user) created.
■ Recipe Lists:
Our users would like to store previous meals or their favorite recipes so
that meals will become easier to replicate in the future. They can store
recipes within lists of recipes. Additionally, depending on the crowd the
user is trying to serve, they can cook meals to navigate dietary or allergy
restrictions. Users will also be able to look at other users’ lists to find new
recipes to try out. Recipes will have optional Category tags to allow for
users to filter through them. For example, a possible category tag could
be ‘Vegetarian.’
Perishable Item Tracking:
Our users will have many ingredients on hand which can lead them to be
unsure which ones are expiring first. They can combat this by storing an
expiry date of each grocery item so they can prioritize cooking the most
perishable items first before they expire. The application will also send a
notification to a user before an item expires to remind them to utilize the
ingredient.

The user can see, based on a few factors, if they can complete a recipe. This allows them to cater meals to different crowds based on allergy ingredients and ensures they prioritize cooking perishable items. The application will also indicate whether the user can complete a recipe (that they or someone else created) based on whether they have all the necessary ingredients.
