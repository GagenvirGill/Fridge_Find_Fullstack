### Project Summary
This kitchen management application allows users to organize their ingredients, recipes, and other information for future use. It enables users to find recipes based on what they currently have at home or informs them of any missing ingredients for a recipe. The app also assists users in discovering new recipes created by other users, with the ability to filter recipes by categories and the user's allergies.

### Project Description
The goal of this application is to help homeowners efficiently manage their kitchen by organizing ingredients and recipes. Users can check if they have the necessary ingredients to complete a recipe or prioritize perishable items that need to be used first. The app also accommodates allergy and dietary preferences, enabling users to find or create meals for specific needs.

### Domain of the Application
Management of Food Items in a Homeowner's Kitchen

The application is designed for homeowners with kitchens, focusing on ingredient management and recipe organization. Users can:

- See if they can complete a recipe based on the ingredients they have.
- Plan meals that cater to dietary or allergy restrictions.
- Prioritize cooking perishable items.

### Database Models

##### 1. Kitchen Ingredients Management
Users can track their kitchen inventory, ensuring they have enough of each ingredient to prepare meals. The application helps users keep track of quantities and other essential information.

##### 2. Recipes
Users can create and follow recipes by adding ingredients, steps, and optional category tags (e.g., Vegetarian, Dessert). This feature allows for easy recipe recreation in the future.

##### 3. Recipe Lists
Users can store favorite recipes in personalized lists, making it easier to replicate meals later. These lists can be tailored to different dietary or allergy restrictions, and users can browse other users' lists to discover new recipes.

##### 4. Perishable Item Tracking
Users can log the expiry dates of ingredients, helping them prioritize the use of perishable items before they spoil. The app also sends notifications when an item is nearing its expiration date.
